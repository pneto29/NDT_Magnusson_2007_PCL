# The NDT algorithm is a registration algorithm that uses standard optimization techniques applied to statistical models of 3D points to determine the most probable registration between two point clouds. For more information on the inner workings of the NDT algorithm, see Dr. Martin Magnusson’s doctoral thesis, “The Three-Dimensional Normal Distributions Transform – an Efficient Representation for Registration, Surface Analysis, and Loop Detection.”
